        <h1>Giant Lemon Panda - Pernillas GIT project</h1>
        <p>The super very big <b>GIANT PANDA</b> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),also known as the panda
            bear or
            simply the panda, is a bear native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_China">central China</a>. It is characterised by large, black patches
            around
            its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish
            it
            from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a
            folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
            Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of
            birds,
            rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or
            bananas
            along with specially prepared food.</p>

        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan">Sichuan</a> , but also in neighbouring
            Shaanxi and Gansu.</p>
        <p>As a result of the farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the
            lowland
            areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239
            pandas
            living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.</p>
        <p>As of December 2014, <b>49 giant pandas</b> lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13
            different
            countries.</p>
        <p>Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,
            while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some
            reports
            also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site
            Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">IUCN</a> reclassified the species from "endangered" to "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Goodbye Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51] Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[52] The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.</p>
